            <p>the challenge: design a chair with upholstery.</p>
            <p>we upholster chairs for comfort, warmth, and luxury. we usually hide the seams and tuck the foam away. </p>
            <p>meanwhile, the squish chair examines the purpose and properties of upholstery and exposes what is usually hidden. the design process, then, began with a search for soft materials that can be exposed and kept clean. the solution was yoga mats.</p>
            <p>to celebrate the insulating aspect of yoga mats' foam, the squish chair was designed to offer sitters privacy while working. thus, the chair's dimensions offer  physical shelter from the sitter's environment through its flexible walls.</p>
        <p>process photos are shown below.</p>

        <div class="caption-1">the nearby nasa studio had some vinyl tubing laying around, which turned out to be a fantastic replacement for armature wire as flexible yet weight-resistant structure for the chair. after some experimentation with riveting, a robust system for wrapping the mats around the vinyl tubing and securing it to the metal frame was devised.</div>
